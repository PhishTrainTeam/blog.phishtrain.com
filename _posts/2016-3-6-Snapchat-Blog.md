title: Snapchat's Embarassing Infiltration
---

Unfortunately, as technology grows and hackers develop, it becomes ever-easier for a person to pose as a company executive and retrieve any information they want. This was obviously evident in the breach on Snapchat the other day. A hacker blasted out a phishing email to multiple employees posing as the company’s CEO. With this, an employee interacted to the email asking to forward over specific employee payroll information. Of course, a member of the Snapchat team sent over that email and suddenly many employees had data about their payment system compromised.

Snapchat quickly recognized the hack and “swiftly and aggressively” discovered the source to alert the FBI about the attack. The photo-based social media system was visibly distraught by the events, but handled it quite well. Another bit of light that came out of the situation was that no user data was leaked. None of the Snapchat servers were breached, so thankfully, all of your secret late night pictures are still tucked away, safe and sound.

Interestingly enough, the attack did not turn any investors away. Snapchat received $175 million in funding from Fidelity Investments less than a week after the phishing email was clicked on by a human resources member. The new valuation of Snapchat comes in at a staggering $16 billion.

While this breach was mostly embarrassing and no extremely sensitive data was leaked that highly affects anyone, it is still terrifying to know that a simple email to a member of HR can take a shot at one of silicon valley’s technology behemoths.
