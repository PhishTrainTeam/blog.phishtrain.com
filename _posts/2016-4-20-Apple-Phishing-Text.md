title: New Apple Scam Targeting iOS Devices
---

An intriguingly common misconception that many people have is that phishing scams occur exclusively over email platforms. In all reality, many of these scams can occur over varrying forms, including phone, hardware, and recently making global headlines, over text message.

Apple, which has its own [outlet for phishing security](https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204759), has becomes the latest high profile company being spoofed as part of an elaborate phsishing scheme. In this scheme, the target is texted from an unknown source posing as AppleInc. The message informs the target that their Apple ID account is set to expire soon and must be updated by following a link embedded within the message. Of course, this link is fraudulent and never actually sends the user to an Apple ID reactivation page. Instead, the user is prompted to enter valuable information which can then be used to steal a user's identity.

Various people have declared the message to be a scam over many different social medaia platforms. One user noted that upon clicking the link the target is led to an "Apple Login Screen". Hackers very commonly use this method in phishing emails to bait users into very quickly and covertly handing over sensitive information, such as email addresses, passwords, and other login credentials. Countless phishing scams have used this method to retriedve employee data and then use that information to masquerade as the victim employee.

Another discrepancy in the email is the use of the URL AppleIDLogin.co.uk (note that this hacking scheme is primarily targeting UK residents but can very quickly target US residents). Apple uses something called subdomains in their emails. For example, the above link is to support.apple.com. Notice that Apple.com is found withing the URL. Apple does not and will not buy domains and will use subdomains 100% of the time. Another way to spot if the link is legitimate or not is whether or not the address bar contains a green-colored lock symbol . This denotes that the website has an active [SSL certificate)](https://www.digicert.com/ssl-certificate.htm) which is a form of security for a website. Without one, which costs quite a bit of money, the website can be dubbed unsafe.

Hopefully, you have learned about this threat and will avoid any messages similar to this one at all costs should one land in your recent text messages.
