title: 1.7 PhishTrain Update
---

Hammerhead sharks are the only species of predatory shark known to group together and hunt in packs. PhishTrain's 1.7 update takes this concept of grouping and brings an all new way to send campaigns to users and view data.

Included in this update:

  -Address Book-
  Add users to an address book either by hand or by a CSV. Include information such as location or department.
  
  -Groups-
  Group together users after submitting them to the address book.
  Quickly and efficiently send to all members of a group without the need for manually inputting all users.
  View group data and see how certain department preform in phishing exercises. This includes an all new progress line graph to see group preformance over time.
  View individual data to see how specific employees preform in phishing exercises. Drilling down is as simple as clicking on their name on a group or campaign page.
  
  -Global Learning Systems Course Results-
  See if employees who fall victim to the phishing exercises complete their required GLS training while on the individual user pages.
  
  -Template Library-
  Select from an assortment of custom made phishing email and landing page templates to copy to your templates for future use in a phishing campaign. Tempaltes will be updated frequently and include a variety of different scenarios, some including recognizable brands.
  
  -Visual Enhancements-
  Withing advanced settings, select from a couple new visual settings including donut charts and chart animations. Select them for yourself and then hit save settings to see what new looks PhishTrain has!
  
  -Admin Login-
  If you choose to allow for more than one person to have full controls on the PhishTrain dashboard, you may want to create additional admin logins. This allows for additional logins to the same PhishTrain account.

We at PhishTrain are extremely excited to bring you the Hammerhead Update. Thank you and happy phishing!
