title: Advance Auto Parts Falls Victim to Phishing Scam
---

In mid-March, Advance Auto Parts reported having fallen victim to a phishing scam. In their report, the car part company discovered the breach quickly, within hours of it happening. Without hesitation, the company reported the attack to the proper cyber crime authorities. No extremely confidential data was compromised. However, some employee data was leaked and in response Advance is making sure to provide proper services to the affected employees. If you are a frequent shopper at Advance, don’t worry, no customer data was released in the breach.


The fast acting of Advance truly helped them in avoiding a much larger problem. If you are in charge of security at your company, or know someone else who is, please make sure it is known what government agency to report to. The IRS has an extensive phishing reporting tool as to alert authorities to what emails are phishing scams as well as providing direct assistance if needed.


Be sure to always look over emails very carefully if some suspicion arises as to the email’s integrity. For more information see our other blog posts or go to PhishTrain.com today.
