title: Advance Auto Parts Falls Victim to Phishing Scam
---

In mid-March, [Advance Auto Parts](advanceautoparts.com) reported that they had fallen victim to a phishing scam saying "On March 7, 2016, a third party obtained unauthorized access to employee information. This
access was through a phishing-type attack in which an outside party posing as an Advance employee convinced an
employee to provide a file containing information about certain individuals who worked for Advance during 2015. The
employee believed the email request for this file was a legitimate". In their [report](http://oag.ca.gov/system/files/ACID_PRINTERPROOFS.NOTICE%20LETTER_0.pdf), the car part retailer said that they had discovered the breach quickly. After doing so the company reported the attack to the proper cyber crime authorities saying that they had "notified federal law enforcement of this incident, requesting that they
investigate fully."

The data compromised in the attack includes employee's social security numbers, and other personally identifiable information.  In response Advance Auto Parts is providing [identity protection services](https://www.allclearid.com/) for the next 24 months at their expence.  No customer data was compromised in the breach.


The fast response of Advance Auto Parts truly helped them in avoiding a much larger problem.  Their actions helped mitigate a wave of identity fraud which could have left them liable for the damages.  The IRS has a [phishing reporting tool](https://www.irs.gov/uac/Report-Phishing)  to alert authorities about phishing scams.  The [Derpatment of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ccips/reporting-computer-internet-related-or-intellectual-property-crime) also suggests filing a complaint with the [Internet Crime Complaint Center](http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx)

This latest attack on a large corporation demonstrates how effective phishing scams can be and how much they can cost companies.  Advance Auto Parts has 70,000 employees and in their report they suggest that they are paying for identity theft protection for the next 2 years for all of them.  This simple mistake costs them lots of money, and the breach could have been much worse had steps not been taken to mitigate the damage.
